There is an application to verify qtversions. It is called qtchooser.

- ```qtchooser -l``` will print the possible qtversions
- ```qtchooser -print-env``` shows the current qt version selected
- ```export QT_SELECT=_v``` (where _v is one of the qt versions printed in the ```qtchooser -l```) will select the qt -v version.
