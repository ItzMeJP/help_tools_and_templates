# Configurting GeForce 3060+ on Ubuntu20

Before boot, include the nomodeset in kernel parameter. Check [this](kernel_tips.md).

Check if the driver is already installed (normally it is included in the kernel of Ubuntu20). For this, go to Software & Updates > Additional Drivers. Selecte the proprietary, tested nvidia driver 470.

Reboot.

Maybe the HDMI will not be loaded by the kernel. The error can be checked by [dmesg or journalctl](kernel_tips.md) commands.

Therefore, add permanently in /etc/defaul/grub the parameter ```pci=realloc```, e.g.

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="pci=realloc"
```

Update the file by:

```
sudo update-grub
```

Reboot the system.

It is possible that Ubuntu gets stuck in the splash purple window sometimes or constantly. This issue is related to the [display server communication protocol](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-enable-disable-wayland-on-ubuntu-20-04-desktop). Therefor disable Wayland protocol, to force Xorg.
```
sudo atom /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
```

Setting Wayland disable by (removing the comment tag...):
```
WaylandEnable=false
```

Then, reboot the system.
